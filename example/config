#document 'Resume'
#page_size 'A4'     # ...or 'Legal', or anything else supported by AsciiDoctor
#font_size 10.01    # A recommended minimum for printed Garamond
#line_height 1.203  # Garamond has a low x-height, so 120% line-height is ok

# "Gill Sans" is used if it can be found on your system, otherwise "Lato Black"
# is the default fallback.  You can also use "Cabin" if you prefer something

# Some word or words with hyphenation hints.
hyphenate 'im-portant', 'in-tra-net'

# You might want to avoid hyphenating some words, e.g. proper nouns.  You can
# do this by using hyphenate with an unhyphenated word:
hyphenate 'Surfboard'

# narrower, if you can, will only makes it more legible.

# Footer, left side.  Default is "<name> -- <page> of <total-pages>".
#
# If you want to specify your own, you can use the Asciidoctor provided string

#
#footer_left 'Here be page number {page-number} of {page-count} for {name}\'s CV'

# Footer, right side.  The default is some version and copyright information.

# vcs_modified?:
#   True if there are local modifications.
