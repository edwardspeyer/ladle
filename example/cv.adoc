=== *Overview* ===

* Cardboard manufacturing specialist with over 20 years of experience with wood
  pulping, corrugation, fold-automation and _This Way Up_  arrow orientation.
  I care about the details and I ship projects on time.

* Most experiencd with *brown*, *white* and *grey* boxes.  Some experience with
  other box colors and also with *process automation* for box making all the
  way from tree-fell to box shipment.

* I have industry standard qualifications in BTM and PBD: *Box Team Management*
  and *Principles of Box Design*.


=== *Professional Experience* ===

==== *GotBoxes.com?* — March 2009 to present ====

* As a _Supervisory Cardboard Technician (Level 7)_ I upgraded our box making
  machine to improve throughput by 140%.  Together with my team of 7 we shipped
  multiple important improvements in box making that were critical to the
  success of _Got Boxes?_ program of intra-business improvements.

* I migrated a legacy chip-and-pulp box-blank workflow to a modern die-cut
  corrugation process.  I successfully specified the system, engaged in a
  compliant tender process, and procured a manufacturer installed system, all
  in under 13 weeks, well below the median turnaround time for this type of
  corrugation system installation.

* I managed a team of 14 _Mullen Test_ technicians and through a series of four
  week sprints over the course of two quarters, I led my team to improve
  paperboard puncture resistance by a factor of five.  This saved the company
  over $400k in the first two quarters after installation.

* In addition to the above duties I also worked on team-building and
  culture-building exercises within the company.  I interviewed 123 new
  technicians of which I hired 15.  I took part in recruiting events and my
  work directly resulted in sourcing and hiring two new site managers, one of
  whom has gone on to be a site director.


==== *Bangor Paper Mills Inc.* -- February 2000 to January 2009 ====

* In my role as a _Senior Paper Mill Assistant_ I was responsible for ensuring
  overall quality control at Bangor's brand new multi-million dollar paper and
  cardboard manufacturing facility.  My work here was twice awarded as being
  exemplary, with awards presented at company all-hands meetings in 2009 and
  2011.

* During my first three years I oversaw a _Six-Sigma_ process through all paper
  and board basis-weights across two plants.  My efforts eradicated all errors
  and blemishes in the product and when I left the department in 2010 we had
  been over 1200 days without incident.

* In 2010 I introduced a new _Boxboard_ quality control process which
  eventually scaled to all board weights throughout the plant.  My work in
  efficiency and process upgrades meant that all subsequent upgrades happened
  at or under 50% of their to-date nominal upgrade times.  This efficiency
  saved $2m over the course of three years.

ifdef::shuffleboard[]
* I also started a company shuffleboard team which went on to win the
  Small-Business Shuffleboard Nationals in 2012, beating off rival
  small-business shuffleboard teams from all over North America.
