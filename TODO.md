## TODO

* Improve the README document, make it into a strong pitch, and proof-read!
* RethinkDB is a nice example, even though it's a larger project
* Test in Debian / non-macOS
* Either drop the LaTeX allusion, or go 100% on it!
* Warn if different recipients / sets of feature flags result in different
  numbers of pages
* Add command line options, even if it's just a way to get started if someone
  runs "ladle --help"
* Command line option to locate 'config' file in a different place?
* Wrap gem-load errors in a less-stack-tracey type message
* Update "gem install" instructions, must use "--pre", probably also
  "--user-install"?
* Pass through document type, and figure out a sensible default paper size.
  Does everyone use A4 now?
