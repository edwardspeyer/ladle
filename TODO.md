## TODO

* Warn if different recipients / sets of feature flags result in different
  numbers of pages

* Pass through document type, and figure out a sensible default paper size.
  Does everyone use A4 now?

* Shorter flags in example config

* Add another conditional to example asciidoc

* Add a page count report?

* Add line height as an option

* Mention EB Garamond as being a low x height, allowing for smaller line
  heights
